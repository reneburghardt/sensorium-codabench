        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>Last change April 2022</p>

		<p>Thank you for using sensorium-competition.net (“Sensorium”). Please read these Terms of Use carefully before participating in Sensorium.</p>

		<p>In addition to the Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy also applies. The Privacy Policy is not part of the Terms of Use.</p>

		<h2>Operator</h2>
		<p>Sensorium is offered as a website under the domain sensorium2022.net. The operator is the Sinzlab.</p>

		<p>The service is provided free of charge and voluntarily. The operator reserves the right to discontinue the service at any time and without any further obligations.</p>

		<h2>User account</h2>
		<p>Access to some of the website’s services requires registration as a user.</p>

		<p>Registration is only permitted for persons with full legal capacity.</p>

		<p>Users undertake not to provide any false information. Furthermore, all registered users undertake to check their personal information regularly and to update it if necessary.</p>

		<p>Registered users are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of the user account, the associated access data and for restricting access to their device (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.). To the extent permitted by applicable law, registered users accept responsibility for all activities carried out on their account. If you discover that third parties have gained knowledge of your access data or that your user account is being used without authorization, the access data must be changed immediately and the operator informed.</p>

		<p>Registered users can change their username and password at any time.</p>

		<p>The user account can be deleted at any time. A corresponding option is integrated in the personal account settings.</p>

		<h2>Competition participation</h2>
		<p>To take part in the competition, users create a project in their user account. To do this, they assign a team name, project title and a description.</p>

		<p>To conduct a competition, the operator provides data sets for download. The participants train their model on this data and upload their predictions to their user account. The operator evaluates the submitted results using a scoring system and thus determines the winning team.</p>

		<p>By participating in the competition, the team members agree that the team name, project title and project description may be published by us for presentation purposes and as part of public relations work. It is up to the participants to formulate the team name, project title and project name in such a way that a reference to the members of the team (natural persons) cannot be made unless this is desired. If this information allows conclusions to be drawn about the team members, only the participants knowingly, willingly and on their own responsibility make this possible.</p>

		<p>By participating, the participants also agree that the operator may use the submitted solutions, code and predictions for scientific work (research and teaching). This data is also shared with scientific partners for the purpose of scientific collaboration. The use of this data for scientific work includes publications (publications, posters, talks, workshops and, if applicable, other public media). For this purpose, the participants transfer the general right of use to the operator without restrictions in terms of space, time or content. This includes the right of reproduction, the right of distribution, the right of exhibition, the right of presentation, the right of performance, the right of presentation, the right of broadcasting and the right of communication to the public. It is the responsibility of the participants to avoid possible references to the natural persons behind the respective solution if this is undesirable. References to natural persons can include names, e-mail addresses, etc. in comments in the code, for example.</p>

		<p>Under no circumstances will the operator use the data provided as part of the competition for purposes other than those specified in these Terms of Use. Deviating agreements must be in writing.</p>
